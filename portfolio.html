    <img src="Cell.jpg" alt="Assembled battery">

    <p> Assembled a 51.8-volt battery pack with Model 3 battery cells by purchasing through online dealers.
        To do this, I needed to connect multiple battery cells in series.
        This means that the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell,
        until the desired or proper voltage is acquired.
        Tesla Model 3 battery cells are known for their high energy density and long lifespan,
        making them a popular choice for building custom battery packs.
